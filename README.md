This is a procedural settlement generation framework for Minecraft's external community tool called "MCEdit".

You can extend the framework by creating your own structure generator. See supplied example "House.py" and "TownSquare.py". Just change the 'chosenVariant' list to include your generator by name. Your file goes in the filters directory alongside the filter STARTPROC_v1.py
